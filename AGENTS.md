# Agent Instructions and Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progress of refactoring `gemini-cli` based on `PLAN.md`.

## Work Summary

### PR #1: Refactoring and Security Hardening (Reverted)
- **Agent:** Jules
- **Status:** Reverted
- **Summary:**
    - Performed a significant code cleanup, refactoring `GeminiClient`, `GeminiChat`, and `subagent.ts` to use a new `LLMProvider` pattern. This involved moving legacy configuration and deleting the obsolete `contentGenerator.ts` file.
    - Began security and privacy hardening by removing the `ClearcutLogger` telemetry system from the codebase.
    - **Action:** Encountered cascading build errors after the initial refactoring. Per user instruction, all changes were reverted to restore the codebase to its last known working state.
